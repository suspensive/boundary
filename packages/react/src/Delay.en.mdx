### props.ms

This component delays the exposure of children by ms. In the code below, exposure of children is delayed by 200ms.

```tsx
import { Delay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Delay ms={200}>
    <Delayed />
  </Delay>
)
```

:::info

#### Delayed loading UI sometimes provides better usability

```tsx
import { Delay, Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense
    fallback={
      <Delay ms={200}>
        <Skeleton />
      </Delay>
    }
  >
    ...
  </Suspense>
)
```

:::tip

### Default ms

`<Delay/>` are more powerful when used with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Control multiple `<Delay/>`s default ms with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Details are introduced in [`<SuspensiveProvider/>` page](./SuspensiveProvider.i18n).

## withDelay

We can use withDelay to wrap component by `<Delay/>` easily.
we don't need to make unncessary code to wrap it if we use withDelay like below.
withDelay's 2nd parameter is props of `<Delay/>` without children

```tsx
import { withDelay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = withDelay(
  function Component() {
    return <>...</>
  },
  { ms: 200 }
)
```
