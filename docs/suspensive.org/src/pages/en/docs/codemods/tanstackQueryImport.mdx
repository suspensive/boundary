# Migrate TanStack Query imports

<Callout type='info'>

This codemod is recommended for updating `@suspensive/react-query` & `@tanstack/react-query` from v4 to v5.

</Callout>

In the `@suspensive/react-query` & `@tanstack/react-query` v5 environment, Suspense Hooks and queryOptions provided by `@suspensive/react-query` are marked as deprecated. This is because `@suspensive/react-query` offers the same APIs (Suspense Hooks and queryOptions) that are available in `@tanstack/react-query` v5. The purpose is to encourage developers to use the v5 API from `@tanstack/react-query` directly.

```shell
npx @suspensive/codemods tanstack-query-import .
```

This codemod automatically transforms import paths from `@suspensive/react-query` to `@tanstack/react-query` v5.

Example:

```tsx
import { queryOptions } from '@suspensive/react-query'
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query-5' // The versioned package is also transformed!
```

After transformation:

```tsx
import { queryOptions } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
```
