# Delay

### props.ms

This component delays the exposure of children by ms. In the code below, exposure of children is delayed by 200ms.

```tsx /ms/
import { Delay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Delay ms={200}>
    <Delayed />
  </Delay>
)
```

<Callout type='info'>

Delayed loading UI sometimes provides better usability

```tsx /Delay/
import { Delay, Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense
    fallback={
      <Delay ms={200}>
        <Skeleton />
      </Delay>
    }
  >
    ...
  </Suspense>
)
```

</Callout>

<Callout>

Default ms

`<Delay/>` are more powerful when used with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Control multiple `<Delay/>`s default ms with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Details are introduced in [`<SuspensiveProvider/>` page](./SuspensiveProvider).

</Callout>

### props.fallback

<Callout type='warning'>

fallback of `<Delay/>` is experimental feature, this interfaces could be changed

</Callout>

fallback will be shown before the delayed exposure of children.

```jsx /fallback/
import { Delay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Delay ms={200} fallback={<>Fallback Text</>}>
    200ms delayed Text
  </Delay>
)
```
