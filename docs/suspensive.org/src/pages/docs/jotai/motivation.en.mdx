# Why Use This?

@suspensive/jotai is used for the following reasons.

<Steps>

### Enhance the Power of Suspense in Jotai

All atoms in Jotai support asynchronous operations like asynchronous reads or writes. By using asynchronous atoms, you can access real data while easily managing the data within the atom.

Jotai's async functionality leverages Suspense to handle asynchronous flows inherently. When an atom initiates an asynchronous request, Suspense gets activated and handles the operation.

By using it together with [@suspensive/react](https://suspensive.org/en/docs/react/motivation), you can use Suspense more powerfully and conveniently.

### Use Async Atoms Declaratively

The provided components have the same interface props as Jotai and can be used declaratively. This allows you to clearly express what triggers Suspense at the same depth, similar to [SuspenseQuery in @suspensive/react-query](https://suspensive.org/en/docs/react-query/SuspenseQuery).

```tsx
import { Atom } from '@suspensive/jotai'
import { Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'
import { UserProfile } from '~/components'
import { userAtom } from "~/atoms";

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense fallback="loading...">
    <Atom atom={userAtom}>{([data]) => <UserProfile key={data.id} {...data} />}
  </Suspense>
)
```

### Utilize Jotai's Community Resources

Jotai has various community resources such as [Query](https://jotai.org/docs/extensions/query) and [Cache](https://jotai.org/docs/extensions/cache). Suspense is also supported in these community resources.

As shown in the example below, you can use it declaratively with [jotai-tanstack-query](https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-tanstack-query).

```tsx
import { AtomValue } from '@suspensive/jotai'
import { Suspense, ErrorBoundary } from '@suspensive/react'
import { UserProfile } from '~/components'
import { userQueryAtom } from '~/queries'

const PostsPage = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={({ error }) => <>{error.message}</>}>
    <Suspense fallback={'loading...'}>
      <AtomValue atom={userQueryAtom}>
        {({ data: user }) => <UserProfile key={user.id} {...user} />}
      </AtomValue>
    </Suspense>
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

</Steps>
