# Installation

<Steps>

### Check supported browsers

Suspensive Libraries are optimized for modern browsers. It is compatible with the following browsers config

<br />

<table>
  <tbody>
    {[
      { browser: 'Chrome', version: '>= 51' },
      { browser: 'Firefox', version: '>= 53' },
      { browser: 'Edge', version: '>= 18' },
      { browser: 'Safari', version: '>= 11' },
      { browser: 'iOS', version: '>= 11' },
      { browser: 'Opera', version: '>= 38' },
    ].map((item) => (
      <tr key={item.browser}>
        <td>{item.browser}</td>
        <td className="text-center">{item.version}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

> Depending on your environment, you might need to add polyfills. If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from node_modules yourselves.

### Add as Dependencies

@suspensive/react-query lives in npm. To install the latest stable version, run the following command

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@suspensive/react-query?color=000&labelColor=000&logo=npm&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suspensive/react-query)

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @suspensive/react-query @tanstack/react-query@4
```

<Callout type='info'>

@suspensive/react-query internally uses @tanstack/react-query v4 as peerDependencies. Therefore, make sure the correct version of @tanstack/react-query is installed in the dependencies of package.json. The reason is explained in [Why need to use?](./motivation).
