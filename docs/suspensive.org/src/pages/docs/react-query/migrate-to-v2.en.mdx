# Migrating to v2

@suspensive/react-query v1 was initially one of the community resources for TanStack Query v4 and was a library that provided previews of `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` in @tanstack/react-query v4 not officially.

However, @tanstack/react-query v5 officially added `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` as hooks for Suspense. So, **we want to make @suspensive/react-query v2 a library by making the interface as similar to the original as possible to make it easier for developers to migrate to @tanstack/react-query v5**.

And @tanstack/react-query v4 is still useful in teams that have difficulty introducing the latest version due to the high browser specifications required by @tanstack/react-query v5.

Even in such cases, we want to make this library useful if you want to use hooks for suspense.

## Handling BREAKING CHANGES

### Removed `enabled`, `placeholderData` option of `useSuspenseQuery`

```diff
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api.text()
-   enabled: Math.random() > 0.5,
-   placeholderData: 'placeholder'
  })
}
```

### Removed `enabled`, `placeholderData` option of `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery`

```diff
import { useSuspenseInfiniteQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const infiniteQuery = useSuspenseInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api.text()
-   enabled: Math.random() > 0.5,
-   placeholderData: 'placeholder'
  })
}
```

### Unified interface naming for options and return type of `useSuspenseQuery` same with @tanstack/react-query v5's useSuspenseQuery

```diff filename="index.ts of @suspensive/react-query"
export { useSuspenseQuery } from './useSuspenseQuery'
export type {
- BaseUseSuspenseQueryResult,
  UseSuspenseQueryOptions,
- UseSuspenseQueryResultOnLoading,
- UseSuspenseQueryResultOnSuccess,
+ UseSuspenseQueryResult
} from './useSuspenseQuery'
export { useSuspenseQueries } from './useSuspenseQueries'
+ export type { SuspenseQueriesOptions, SuspenseQueriesResults } from './useSuspenseQueries'
export { useSuspenseInfiniteQuery } from './useSuspenseInfiniteQuery'
export type {
- BaseUseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResult,
  UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryOptions,
- UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResultOnLoading,
- UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResultOnSuccess,
+ UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResult
} from './useSuspenseInfiniteQuery'
- export { QueryAsyncBoundary } from './QueryAsyncBoundary'
export { QueryErrorBoundary } from './QueryErrorBoundary'
```
