# Suspense

@suspensive/react's `<Suspense/>` will be just [Suspense of original React](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

### props.fallback

fallback works the same as fallback of original React's Suspense.

```tsx /Suspense/
import { Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <Children />
  </Suspense>
)
```

<Callout>

Default fallback

`<Suspense/>` are more powerful when used with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`.
Control multiple `<Suspense/>`s default fallback with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Details are introduced in [`<SuspensiveProvider/>` page](./SuspensiveProvider).

</Callout>

### Avoid Server side rendering (CSROnly)

`<Suspense.CSROnly/>` will return fallback in server. After mount(in client) return children. Since mount only happens on the client, server-side rendering can be avoided.

```tsx /Suspense/
import { Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense.CSROnly fallback={<Loading />}>
    <Children />
  </Suspense.CSROnly>
)
```

<Callout type='info'>

Migration support SSR gradually (`<Suspense.CSROnly/>` -> `<Suspense/>`)

If you want to use Suspense working in both SSR/CSR, You can change `<Suspense.CSROnly/>` to `<Suspense/>` gradually.

</Callout>

## withSuspense

You can use withSuspense to wrap component by `<Suspense/>` easily.
we don't need to make unncessary code to wrap it if we use withSuspense like below.
withSuspense's 2nd parameter is props of `<Suspense/>` without children

```tsx /withSuspense/
import { withSuspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = withSuspense(
  function Component() {
    // code make suspending

    return <>...</>
  },
  { fallback: <Spinner /> }
)

const Example = withSuspense.CSROnly(
  function Component() {
    // code make suspending

    return <>...</>
  },
  { fallback: <Spinner /> }
)
```
