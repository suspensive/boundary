# useSuspenseQuery

There is no isLoading or isError in the return type of this hook. This is because `<Suspense/>` and `<ErrorBoundary/>` guarantee the data of this hook. Also, in the options of this hook, suspense is set to true by default. Any new options you need can be used like @tanstack/react-query's [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery).

```tsx /useSuspenseQuery/
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey,
    queryFn,
  }) // suspense: true is the default.

  // No type narrowing required with isSuccess.
  query.data // TData
}
```

### motivation

You can use [useQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery) with `<Suspense/>` and `<ErrorBoundary/>` by using the suspense option in @tanstack/react-query.

```tsx /useQuery/
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const query = useQuery({
    queryKey,
    queryFn,
    suspense: true,
  })

  query.data // TData | undefined

  if (query.isSuccess) {
    query.data // TData
  }
}
```

The return type of useQuery (query.data) will always be a success case thanks to this component's parents, `<Suspense/>` and `<ErrorBoundary/>`.
But @tanstack/react-query doesn't express this typescript typely.

That's why @suspensive/react-query provides **useSuspenseQuery**.

<Callout>

Focus on successful cases.

Now we can focus only on successful cases as fetching always succeeds inside our component.
