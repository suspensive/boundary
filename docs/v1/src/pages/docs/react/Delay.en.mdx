# Delay

### props.ms

This component delays the exposure of children by ms. In the code below, exposure of children is delayed by 200ms.

```tsx /Delay/
import { Delay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Delay ms={200}>
    <Delayed />
  </Delay>
)
```

<Callout type="info">

Delayed loading UI sometimes provides better usability

```tsx /Delay/
import { Delay, Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense
    fallback={
      <Delay ms={200}>
        <Skeleton />
      </Delay>
    }
  >
    ...
  </Suspense>
)
```

</Callout>

<Callout>

Default ms

`<Delay/>` are more powerful when used with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Control multiple `<Delay/>`s default ms with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`. Details are introduced in [`<SuspensiveProvider/>` page](./SuspensiveProvider).

</Callout>

## withDelay

<Callout type='warning'>

deprecated: Use [wrap.Delay().on](./wrap) instead

</Callout>

We can use withDelay to wrap component by `<Delay/>` easily.
we don't need to make unncessary code to wrap it if we use withDelay like below.
withDelay's 2nd parameter is props of `<Delay/>` without children

```tsx /withDelay/
import { withDelay } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = withDelay(
  function Component() {
    return <>...</>
  },
  { ms: 200 }
)
```
