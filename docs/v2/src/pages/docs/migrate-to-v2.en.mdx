# Migrating to Suspensive v2 (Work in progress)

Suspensive V2, we focused on increasing `compatibility` and `improving DX`.
To accomplish this, we had to introduce some dramatic changes, which resulted in the removal of some previously deprecated features.

## Upgrade steps

Here is a list of steps to migrate your project to v2.

<Steps>

### Update our package version

```sh
yarn up '@suspensive/*'
#or
pnpm up "@suspensive/*"
```

Make sure you update all `@suspensive` packages you use to `@suspensive/<package-name>@2.0.0` and your react dependencies to at least v18

### Check React version with v18

<Callout>

ðŸš¨ Suspensive v2 is not backwards compatible with React v17 and lower. Make sure to upgrade to React v18.

</Callout>

Here is how your dependencies could look like:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@suspensive/react": "^2.0.0",
    "@suspensive/react-query": "^2.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

</Steps>

## Handling BREAKING CHANGES

### @suspensive/react

#### `removed` AsyncBoundary

We removed AsyncBoundary in v2 [#295](https://github.com/suspensive/react/issues/295)

AsyncBoundary's feature is just wrap two component(Suspense, Errorboundry) by one.
So, you can split by two like this.

```diff
- <AsyncBoundary pendingFallback={<Loading />} rejectedFallback={<Error />} onError={onError} onReset={onReset}>
+ <Errorboundry fallback={<Error />} onError={onError} onReset={onReset}>
+   <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <Children />
- </AsyncBoundary>
+   </Suspense>
+ </Errorboundry>
```

## Deprecated features

### withSuspense, withDelay, withErrorboundry, withErrorBoundaryGroup

This hocs are deprecated by new hoc `wrap`

### @suspensive/react
